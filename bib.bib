abstract="We present a fully proof-producing implementation of a quantifier elimination procedure for real closed fields. To our knowledge, this is the first generally useful proof-producing implementation of such an algorithm. While many problems within the domain are intractable, we demonstrate convincing examples of its value in interactive theorem proving.",

abstract = {This book meets the demand for a self-contained and broad-based account of the concepts, the machinery and the use of automated reasoning. The mathematical logic foundations are described in conjunction with practical application, all with the minimum of prerequisites. The approach is constructive, concrete and algorithmic: a key feature is that methods are described with reference to actual implementations (for which code is supplied) that readers can use, modify and experiment with. This book is ideally suited for those seeking a one-stop source for the general area of automated reasoning. It can be used as a reference, or as a place to learn the fundamentals, either in conjunction with advanced courses or for self study.}

edition = {1st},
abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) combine cyber capabilities, such as computation orcommunication, with physical capabilities, such as motion or other physical processes. Cars,aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that isdetermined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms ischallenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior, while it is vital that thesealgorithms be correct because we rely on them for safety-critical tasks. This textbook teaches undergraduate students the core principles behind CPSs. Itshows them how to develop models and controls; identify safety specifications andcritical properties; reason rigorously about CPS models; leverage multi-dynamicalsystems compositionality to tame CPS complexity;identify required control constraints;verify CPS models of appropriate scale in logic; and develop an intuitionfor operational effects. The book is supported with homework exercises, lecture videos, and slides.}
