abstract = {This book meets the demand for a self-contained and broad-based account of the concepts, the machinery and the use of automated reasoning. The mathematical logic foundations are described in conjunction with practical application, all with the minimum of prerequisites. The approach is constructive, concrete and algorithmic: a key feature is that methods are described with reference to actual implementations (for which code is supplied) that readers can use, modify and experiment with. This book is ideally suited for those seeking a one-stop source for the general area of automated reasoning. It can be used as a reference, or as a place to learn the fundamentals, either in conjunction with advanced courses or for self study.}

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) combine cyber capabilities, such as computation orcommunication, with physical capabilities, such as motion or other physical processes. Cars,aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that isdetermined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms ischallenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior, while it is vital that thesealgorithms be correct because we rely on them for safety-critical tasks. This textbook teaches undergraduate students the core principles behind CPSs. Itshows them how to develop models and controls; identify safety specifications andcritical properties; reason rigorously about CPS models; leverage multi-dynamicalsystems compositionality to tame CPS complexity;identify required control constraints;verify CPS models of appropriate scale in logic; and develop an intuitionfor operational effects. The book is supported with homework exercises, lecture videos, and slides.}

A decision method must be like a recipe, which tells one what to do at each steps so that no intelligence is required to follow it; and the method can be applied by anyone so long as he is able to read and follow directions.",

pages={85-101},
abstract={{\enspace}We present a new, ``elementary'' quantifier elimination method for various special cases of the general quantifier elimination problem for the first-order theory of real numbers. These include the elimination of one existential quantifier ∃x in front of quantifier-free formulas restricted by a non-trivial quadratic equation in x (the case considered also in [7]), and more generally in front of arbitrary quantifier-free formulas involving only polynomials that are quadratic in x. The method generalizes the linear quantifier elimination method by virtual substitution of test terms in [9]. It yields a quantifier elimination method for an arbitrary number of quantifiers in certain formulas involving only linear and quadratic occurrences of the quantified variables. Moreover, for existential formulas ϕ of this kind it yields sample answers to the query represented by ϕ. The method is implemented in REDUCE as part of the REDLOG package (see [4, 5]). Experiments show that the method is applicable to a range of benchmark examples, where it runs in most cases significantly faster than the QEPCAD package of Collins and Hong. An extension of the method to higher degree polynomials using Thom's lemma is sketched.},
