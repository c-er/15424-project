# Implementation

The directory `lib` contains our library dependencies [Fraction.js](https://github.com/infusion/Fraction.js) and
[Polynomial.js](https://github.com/infusion/Polynomial.js). `signmat.js` contains the sign matrix computation
implementation. `uni.js` contains the univariate decision procedure implementation. `harness.html`
is for testing the embedding of the two scripts into a webpage.
